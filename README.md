# GitChronicle

Imagine this common scenario:

- You are a developer.
- Someone wants to know what you've worked on in the past month.
- You don't use any tracker and you obviously don't take manual notes.
- You are kinda screwed.
- You end up going through emails, chats and GitHub commits trying to come up with what you could have possibly been doing for the last month. 

Sound miserable, right? That's because it is. And it happens. More often than it should.

## Well, not anymore!

GitChronicle solves this problem! This simple CLI is here for you, it goes through your folder containing your projects and returns the Git commits aggregated by day. 

Additional features include:
- Filtering unwanted repositories
- Export the obtained overview to CSV, XLS, ...
